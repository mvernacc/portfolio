      <h1>Matt Vernacchia</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>Sedentary life leaves me edgy and unfulfilled. I thrive on challenging projects which push the boundaries of the technically possible. I am happiest when learning a new skill or creating a novel device. I find myself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_(book)">drawn, by a craving I can hardly articulate or understand, to undiscovered ideas and new worlds</a>. I study rocket propulsion and robotics, and I love to imagine the new worlds I could help create with those skills: a world of self-driving cars, of buzzing delivery drones, or a whole new planet colonized out of barren rock.</p>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_(book)"><i><p>Maybe it's a little early — maybe the time is not quite yet — but those other worlds, promising untold opportunities, beckon.</p></i></a>

          <h3>Strand burner for solid propellant testing</h3>
          <p>As part of my Master's research, I designed and built a device to measure the burning rate of solid rocket propellant at elevated pressure. I improved the device though 3 iterations.</p>

          <h3>Rocket-deployed quadrotor</h3>
          <p>As a sophomore on Rocket Team, I designed and built a quadrotor which folded to fit within a 6 inch diameter rocket. After being launched to 1 mile altitude, the quadrotor would deploy, unfold, and fly autonomously or under remote control. I machined all of the mechanical components and used a Ardupilot Mega for control and communications. I also built and successfully used an emergency parachute system which saved the quadrotor if it lost control.</p>

          <h3>High altitude balloon</h3>
          <p>As a lab assistant for the Unified Engineering class, I developed a new lab project in which students launch a balloon to the upper stratosphere (70 kft). I designed, built, and flew a prototype balloon with an Arduino-based weather sensing payload. I then wrote an instruction manual for building the system, and coached students though the building and launching process.</p>

          <h3>Hammock hardpoint</h3>
          <p>I wanted an excuse to learn TIG welding, so I made these hardpoints to mount a hammock to my walls. To determine the required load capacity, I implemented a visco-elastic rope model in python, and simulated the dynamic force on the hardpoints from a person moving in the hammock.</p>

          <h3>2D Shock-Capturing CFD</h3>
          <p>For a numerical methods class, I programmed a 2D Euler equation (inviscid Navier-Stokes) solver using a finite-difference MacCormack method. I used artificial dissipation to reduce the non-physical oscillations which occur around shocks in finite difference schemes. My software was implemented in Julia.</p>

          <h3>Biosleeve gesture interface</h3>
          <p>Biosleeve is a wearable hand-gesture sensor for controlling robots and actuated prostheses. As an intern at JPL, I worked on a SVM learning algorithm to classify hand gestures fro EMG signals, and developed software interfaces between Biosleeve and several robots. Our work was presented at ICRA 2013. Our software was implemented in MATLAB and C.</p>

          <h3>Aerospike nozzle design GUI</h3>
          <p>I implemented a method-of-characteristics aerospike nozzle geometry algorithm in python. I created a GUI which enables users to enter engine parameters and view results. After executing the nozzle design algorithm, the program plots temperature, pressure, and Mach number along the nozzle length, and can export the nozzle geometry in a CAD-compatible format.</p>

          <h3>proptools</h3>
          <p>Sick of banging out propulsion design equations on my calculator, I implemented some of the formulas from RPE and Huzel &amp; Huang in python. The code is indented for personal use at the moment, but someday I hope to expand it into a broader and more user-friendly library.</p>

          <h3>Blended wing-body analysis</h3>
          <p>I used AVL and CFD (SolidWorks Simulation) software to analyze the transonic drag and stability of a blended wing-body aircraft. We then modified the design to reduce shock-induced drag and increase the stability margin. Connie Liu, James Logan, and Julia CrowleyFarenga worked with me.</p>

          <h3>Dragon V2 flight simulator</h3>
          <p>During 3 internships with SpaceX, I helped to develop a flight simulator for Dragon V2. I trained several NASA astronauts to fly the simulator, and helped collect their feedback on the display's UI/UX features and on the vehicle's handling qualities. I then worked with human factors experts, designers, and controls engineers to fix issues discovered in these tests. The simulator is implemented in C++.</p>

          <p>MASLab is an autonomous robotics competition for MIT undergrads. I coded a finite state machine and vision-based navigation for our robot in python. Our robot's task was to explore an arena. collect balls, then dump the balls into the opponent's territory. We took 2nd place in the competition.</p>
