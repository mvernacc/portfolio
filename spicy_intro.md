# Pale Bule Dot remix
Sedentary life leaves me edgy and unfulfilled. I thrive on challenging projects which push the boundaries of the technically possible. I am happiest when learning a new skill or creating a novel device. I find myself drawn, by a craving I can hardly articulate or understand, to undiscovered ideas and new worlds. I study rocket propulsion and robotics, and I love to imagine the new worlds I could help create with those skills: a world of self-driving cars, of buzzing delivery drones, or a whole new planet colonized out of barren rock. 

Maybe it's a little early — maybe the time is not quite yet — but those other worlds, promising untold opportunities, beckon.

# Man in the Arena remix
I thrive on grabbing big challenges, on teaching myself to do something I am perhaps not quite qualified for. I am drawn to ambitious, high-impact projects; I love to know great enthusiasm and spend myself in a worthy cause. Professionally, I enjoy the exactness and daring required by propulsion and robotics. Pushing the technically possible in a moment of truth, hours or months of work and testing hanging on the question: will the engine start smoothly or explode? Will the estimator converge? If everything works, the rewards are high, and if I fail, I at least fail while daring greatly; and the next iteration is only a few steps away.
