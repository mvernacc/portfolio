        <h1>Strand burner for solid propellant testing</h1>
        <p>As part of my Master's research, I designed and built a device to measure the burning rate of solid rocket propellant at elevated pressure. I improved the device though 3 iterations.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>My Master's research project is a transonic, rocket-propelled UAV. Long endurance is a important mission objective, and this requires the UAV's motor to have a long burn time. To achieve maximum burn time, I am developing an ultra-slow-burning ammonium nitrate composite propellant.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>One of the key steps in the development of a new solid rocket propellant is to characterize the burn rate as a function of pressure. The burn rate ($r$) versus pressure ($p$) relationship is typically modeled by Vielle's Law:
      $$r = a p^n$$
      where $a$ and $n$ are parameters which must be determined experimentally.</p>
      <p>The apparatus for these experiments is called a strand burner. The strand burner allows a small (~10 g) strand of propellant to be burned at a set pressure and provides a method to measure the burn rate of the propellant (in my case, the propellant sample burns within a transparent tube, and the burn rate is measured by video).</p>
      <p>The strand burner experiment is repeated at many pressures, and a power law fit is performed on the resulting data. Then, the experimental values of $a$ and $n$ can be used to design a rocket motor which uses the new propellant.</p>

      <h2>Design</h2>

      </figure>

      <p>The propellant sample is cast into a 15.4 mm (0.606 inch) OD quartz glass tube. The glass tube is loaded into the sample holder (part number FF-SB3-01-000). The sample holder has O-ring grooves to form a shaft seal against the walls of the sample tube. When the propellant sample burns, the exhaust flows though the temperature Sensing assembly (FF-SB3-03-000) into the chamber (FF-SB3-02-000). The chamber is pressurized with argon gas at the set pressure for the particular experiment. As exhaust is added to the chamber, the pressure would rise - to prevent this, a backpressure regulator (FF-SB3-06-000) vents the chamber. The large volume of the chamber adds "inertia" to the differential equation governing the chamber pressure, thereby reducing the magnitude of the pressure excursions caused by the dynamics of the regulator.</p>

      <p>The chamber is built from a 6061-T6 aluminum tube, capped with plates. Circular grooves in the plates mate to the tube ends, and O-rings in the grooves form a crush seal. The end plates are held in place by four grade 8 3/8-16 threaded rods. The rod tension and chamber wall thickness are designed to a safety factor of 10 at an internal pressure of 3.45 MPa (500 psi).</p>

      <h2>Ignition</h2>

        <img src="../assets/images/firefly/SB3_laser_glow.png">
        <figcaption>A propellant sample glows purple with refracted laser light moments before igniting.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The propellant sample is ignited by a 2.5 W, 455 nm laser. The laser delivers a surface heat flux of 0.8 MW / m$^2$ is delivered, which is sufficient to ignite the propellant.</p>
      <p>The laser is Class IV, so safety measures are required to prevent eye damage. I set up an interlock switch to prevent the laser from being operated when the room's door is open, and we wear laser goggles when focusing and aligning the beam.</p>
      <p>Previously, we had used pyrotechnic igniters, but these were unreliable, and reloading the igniter between tests took a long time. The laser igniter provides more consistent ignition, reduces the time require to perform an experiment, and improves safety.</p>

      <h2>Fabrication</h2>

      </figure>
      <p>The chamber cylinder is the largest (102 mm (4 inch) diameter by 610 mm (24 inch) long) part I've ever put on a lathe. The part is far too long to hold just by the chuck jaws, but <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu/users/pat-mcatamney">Pat (the shop technician)</a> showed me how to use a steady rest to support it. Centering the part in the steady rest was tedious, but I managed to get all the turned faced concentric to within 0.076 mm (0.003 inch).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Another new trick I learned on this build was to use grooving tool to cut an O-ring gland into the inner diameter of a tube.</p>
      <p>The remaining parts were fairly straightforward to make with a CNC mill and waterjet.</p>
      
      <h2>Iteration</h2>

      <p>The design presented above is the third version of the strand burner. In the first version, the propellant sample was mounted inside the chamber, and the chamber was made from acrylic to permit viewing. However, smoke from the exhaust filled the chamber, blocking the view of the burning sample. Also, the acrylic blistered and discolored after several firings, limiting the useful life of the device.</p>
      <p>Version 2 of the strand burner solved these issues by mounting the sample on the outside of the chamber. This required the sample tube be loaded with internal pressure. Despite the poor tensile properties of quartz glass, I was able to find a sufficiently thick-walled tube to meet this load. However, v2 revealed a new set of flaws: its backpressure regulator became corroded and clogged with soot, and as the regulator clogged the internal pressure varied. Also, reloading a propellant sample in v2 required removing and replacing several #6 screws, and installing a new pyrotechnic igniter. We wear fire-resistant gloves when handling propellant, so these dexterous operations were slow and frustrating.</p>
      <p>Version 3 solves these problems: a large chamber reduces pressure variations, a stainless steel backpressure regulator resists corrosion, and filters prevent soot from reaching the regulator. The propellant sample is installed and removed with a toggle clamp, and the laser igniter is safe and reusable.</p>
