# Matt Vernacchia's Engineering Portfolio

I am currently a software engineer at [Commonwealth Fusion Systems](https://cfs.energy), where I develop optimization software to aid the design of superconducting magnets and fusion devices for clean energy. 

I hold a PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT, where I developed rocket propulsion systems for small, fast aircraft. These aircraft can fly at 1000 km/hr and are 10x smaller than any air vehicle of comparable speed. Along with my labmates, I fabricated rocket components with metal additive manufacturing, mixed solid rocket propellants, test-fired solid rocket motors, and simulated combustion and heat transfer. I led the development of our lab's solid rocket capabilities from a clean sheet. ([more about this project](project_pages/firefly.md))

I love the process of brining difficult technologies from theory to implementation. My experience in analysis, mechanical design, prototyping, and software make me well suited to a fast-paced R&D environment. I built these skills while leading several rocket propulsion projects at MIT ([1](project_pages/pyralis.md), [2](hardware_projects/#3d-printed-solid-rocket-motor), [3](project_pages/firefly/#rocket-motor)), integrating a [flight simulator](software_projects/#crew-dragon-flight-simulator) for astronauts at SpaceX, and prototyping [new human-robot interfaces](publications/#gesture-based-robot-control-with-variable-autonomy-from-the-jpl-biosleeve) at JPL, among other experiences.

Finding meaning in my work is important to me. I prefer to work with passionate teams on projects with the potential to bend the future of humanity towards better outcomes.
