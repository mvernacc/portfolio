I worked with my Rocket Team teammates and 3D printing startup Markforged to create and fire the world's first successful rocket motor printed from plastic. Markforged's printers place glass fibers into the part during printing, which helps the plastic to (temporarily) withstand the intense heat of the rocket exhaust.

I led the development of a 2 kN thrust, ethanol / nitrous oxide, pressure-fed rocket engine with an aerospike nozzle.

I built my own ice ax for a trip to Mt. Washington. The ax is constructed from steel and poplar, and is reinforced with composites.

## High altitude balloon

    <div class="proj_image_div"><img src="../assets/images/unified_balloon.bmp"></div>
    <div class="proj_text">
As a lab assistant for the Unified Engineering class, I developed a new lab project in which students launch a balloon to the upper stratosphere (70 kft). I designed, built, and flew a prototype balloon with an Arduino-based weather sensing payload. I then wrote an instruction manual for building the system, and coached students though the building and launching process.

## Rocket-deployed quadrotor
<div class="proj_outer">
    <div class="proj_image_div"><img src="../assets/images/rt_quad.jpg"></div>
    <div class="proj_text">
As a sophomore on Rocket Team, I designed and built a quadrotor which folded to fit within a 6 inch diameter rocket. After being launched to 1 mile altitude, the quadrotor would deploy, unfold, and fly autonomously or under remote control. I machined all of the mechanical components and used a Ardupilot Mega for control and communications. I also built and successfully used an emergency parachute system which saved the quadrotor if it lost control.
