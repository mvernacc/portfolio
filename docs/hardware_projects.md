I built my own ice ax for a trip to Mt. Washington. The ax is constructed from steel and poplar, and is reinforced with composites.

    <div class="proj_text">
As a lab assistant for the Unified Engineering class, I developed a new lab project in which students launch a balloon to the upper stratosphere (70 kft). I designed, built, and flew a prototype balloon with an Arduino-based weather sensing payload. I then wrote an instruction manual for building the system, and coached students though the building and launching process.

## Rocket-deployed quadrotor

    <div class="proj_text">
As a sophomore on Rocket Team, I designed and built a quadrotor which folded to fit within a 6 inch diameter rocket. After being launched to 1 mile altitude, the quadrotor would deploy, unfold, and fly autonomously or under remote control. I machined all of the mechanical components and used a Ardupilot Mega for control and communications. I also built and successfully used an emergency parachute system which saved the quadrotor if it lost control.
