</div>
Hoverjet is a jet-powered, vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. I designed the airframe and control mechanisms, and led the fabrication and assembly of the vehicle.

## Additively manufactured titanium rocket component

</div>
This is a component of our research rocket motor which I designed and which is manufactured by Renishaw plc. It illustrates my experience interacting with a manufacturing shop and using GD&T to communicate in drawings.

## 3D printed solid rocket motor

    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/plastic_rocket/diamonds.jpg"></div>
</div>
I worked with my Rocket Team teammates and 3D printing startup Markforged to create and fire the first successful rocket motor printed from plastic. Markforged's printers place glass fibers into the part during printing, which helps the plastic to (temporarily) withstand the intense heat of the rocket exhaust.

    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/firefly/strand_burner_subsystems.png"></div>
</div>
I designed and built a device to measure the burning rate of solid rocket propellant at elevated pressure. I improved the device though 4 iterations.

## Pyralis rocket engine
<div class="proj_image_row">
    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/pyralis/engine_components.png"></div>
    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/pyralis/nozzle.png"></div>
    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/pyralis/n2o_ignition.png"></div>
</div>

I led the development of a 2 kN thrust, ethanol / nitrous oxide, pressure-fed rocket engine with an aerospike nozzle.

## Ice ax

    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/ice_ax/vac_bag.jpg"></div>
</div>

I built my own ice ax for a trip to Mt. Washington. The ax is constructed from steel and poplar, and is reinforced with composites.

## High altitude balloon
<div class="proj_outer">
    <div class="proj_image_div"><img src="../assets/images/unified_balloon.bmp"></div>
    <div class="proj_text">
As a lab assistant for the Unified Engineering class, I developed a new lab project in which students launch a balloon to the upper stratosphere (70 kft). I designed, built, and flew a prototype balloon with an Arduino-based weather sensing payload. I then wrote an instruction manual for building the system, and coached students though the building and launching process. This photograph was taken by a camera on board one of our baloons.

## Rocket-deployed quadrotor
<div class="proj_outer">
    <div class="proj_image_div"><img src="../assets/images/rt_quad.jpg"></div>
    <div class="proj_text">
As a sophomore on Rocket Team, I designed and built a quadrotor which folded to fit within a 6 inch diameter rocket. After being launched to 1 mile altitude, the quadrotor would deploy, unfold, and fly autonomously or under remote control. I machined all of the mechanical components and used a Ardupilot Mega for control and communications. I also built and successfully used an emergency parachute system which saved the quadrotor if it lost control.

## Loft bed
<div class="proj_image_row">
    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/loft_bed_exploded_drawing.svg"></div>
    <div class="proj_image_row_image_container"><img src="../assets/images/loft_bed_in_room.jpg"></div>
</div>

I helped my flatmates to design and build loft beds for our apartment. I put some effort into making drawings and instructions, which enabled us to quickly build two identical beds and assemble them without issues. Unlike many loft bed designs, this structure is sufficiently stiff to handle the expected dynamic loads.

    <div class="proj_text">
A silly device that I designed and printed for my friend's birthday party. Printed on a Form 2 stereo-lithography printer, which can produce gas-tight parts. *In collaboration with Kelly Mathesius.*
