# The "10 x 10 x 10" definition of energy abundance

*2025*

I like the "energy abundance" take on the energy / climate debates.
I also like clear, numerical definitions of shared goals.
The following is my attempt to provide a clear, memorable, and quantitative definition for the goal of "energy abundance":

> Our grand challenge is to provide  
> a **10 kilowatt per person** standard of living  
> for **10 billion people**  
> in ways that sustain human civilization  
> and its vital harmony with our environment  
> over the next **10 thousand years**.


## Rationale

### Why energy abundance?

I want a future where more people lead flourishing, fulfilling lives.
A future of creation.
A future that most people will be excited to help build.

Morally, I want the opportunity and standard of living I desire for my children to be available to all people.
This argues both for abundance, so that more people can share in these benefits,
and for sustainability, so that future generations can continue to share in them.
This is not to say that wealth and comfort ought to be the primary goals of life.
A life with purpose and loving connection is far more important than material wealth.
But, issues of energy supply directly impact the material dimensions of life.

Indirectly, however, attitudes towards energy and resources influence our attitudes toward our fellow humans, and our mental/spiritual wellbeing.
I believe that an orientation toward creation and stewardship is healthier than an orientation towards guilt and deprivation.
I am concerned that many arguments for de-growth are twisted in unhealthy relationships with shame and anger.
What might be done by a generation raised to view their fellow humans as a cancer upon the Earth?


Practically, the success of the energy transition relies on billions of people actively participating in it, and that is far more likely if those people view the transition as desirable.
A message of abundance and opportunity inspires more aligned action than a message of darkness and deprivation.
Compared to a strategy of de-growth, a strategy of energy abundance is more likely to be carried out successfully and less likely to spawn backlash and subversion.

Put simply, our goal needs to be a materially good deal for most people, and to be mentally good for the people who believe in it.


### Why 10 kilowatts per person?



### Why 10 billion people?

the anti-natalists are wrong and self-defeating


### Why 10 thousand years?


## Implications




## Misc



Arguments against de-growth:

Probably don't dwell on the anti-de-growth side too much, too negative.

- It is deeply unrealistic to expect an "mass awakening", in which a large population suddenly becomes more willing to sacrifice for the common good. De-growth is unlikely to be willingly undertaken at a scale that matters.

- The political means to force de-growth on an unwilling population are destructive to human wellbeing and civilization.

- Further, de-growth policies are not practical in a multi-polar world.
If some countries implement de-growth and others do not, power and influence shift towards the growers.
Thus, the net direction of human civilization will be on the side of growth.
