The aircraft's mass must be balanced around the center of the jet engine, and must remain balanced as fuel is consumed. Because this is a prototype/testing aircraft, the airframe needs to be reconfigurable (e.g. if we decide to add or move sensors). The aircraft needs to be robust to crashes, and it should be easy to replace components if they break or need to be upgraded.</p> This CAD 3-views shows mounting locations of the aircraft's critical components. <p>I addressed these requirements with a modular design. The main structure is four carbon-fiber frame tubes surrounding the engine. All components are held by 3D-printed brackets which clamp on to the frame tubes. Components can be added or relocated by adjusting the bracket locations or printing new brackets. Maintenance is easy: only a single hex key is needed to remove any component (all fasteners are #6 SHCS), and the frequently-accessed avionics bays are on the outside of the vehicle.</p> <p>The vehicle is designed to be crash tolerant: The landing legs are sized to absorb a 5 m/s crash from any direction.

He does not have CNC cutting machines, so I designed most of the geometrically complicated parts to be made via 3D printing (filament deposition). Below is a time lapse of his Prusa i3 mk3 printing the main frame which holds the jet vanes and frame tubes. The material is a nylon filament filled with chopped carbon fiber (from 3DXTECH). Compared to typical filament plastics (i.e. ABS), it is stronger, stiffer, and maintains it strength up to a higher temperature.</p> Time lapse of printing the main frame. <p>Additive manufacturing is not magic - one still has to pay careful attention to the design-for-manufacturing constraints. However, additive processes have a different set of constraints than traditional cutting and forming processes. Some of the constraints which were important for the Hoverjet parts are:</p> <p>Overhangs - Filament deposition printers cannot print large overhangs, or else the part will sag before the plastic filament cools. When designing the parts for Hoverjet, I considered the orientation in which the part would be printed early in the design process, and shaped the details of the geometry to avoid overhangs in that direction. Some filament printers can allow overhangs by printing a soluble support material under the part, but our printer did not have this capability.</p> <p>Threads and fine holes - Most filament deposition printers do not have sufficient resolution to print threads or fine holes. On Hoverjet, I used heat-set threaded metal inserts to create threads in the printed parts. For holes that needed a close fit around a fastener, I printed the holes undersized, and then drilled them out to the required diameter.</p> <p>Anisotropic strength - Parts made by filament deposition are weaker in the z axis (normal to layers) than in the xy plane (within layers). For loaded parts, the printing orientation was chosen so that the loads would primarily be in the within-layer plane. This sometimes conflicted with the orientation which minimized overhangs, and resolving these conflicts required some judgment.</p> <p>Printing environment - Filament deposition printers are sensitive to the temperature and humidity of the printing environment. Variations in temperature cause the part to cool unevenly, which can distort its geometry or cause layers to peel apart from each other. Many filaments (including nylon) will absorb moisture from humid air, and do not print well when wet. These issues are best managed by printing within an environmentally-controlled build chamber. However, Stratasys Inc. holds a patent on this technology (US 6,722,872), so most hobby-grade printers do not use a build chamber. One can work around this limitation by putting the entire printer within a separately-purchased enclosure. We used this approach, and also put desiccant in the enclosure to keep the humidity down (it's the blue substance in the above video). I put a temperature and humidity gage in the enclosure to monitor the environment.</p> <p>I learned a good deal about additive manufacturing from Prof. John Hart's excellent 2.s998 course.

To reduce radiative heating of the structure, I surrounded the nozzle with a two-layer radiation shield made of aluminum. Infrared radiation from the nozzle must be absorbed and re-radiated by each layer before reaching the structure.

In order to resist the exhaust temperatures, the jet vanes are made from AISI 316 stainless steel.

The blast chamber has thick concrete walls which protect us if the propellant sample explodes during the test. After loading the propellant sample into the strand burner, we run the test remotely from a control and data logging station located outside of the blast chamber. We use checklists to ensure that we operate the apparatus correctly and safely.</p> <p>Laser safety is another operational concern. It is important to not inadvertently turn on the laser while people are working on the apparatus, as the laser could blind someone. We employ magnetic interlocks on the blast chamber door prevent the laser from being energized unless the door is closed, after everyone has exited the chamber.</p>"},{"location":"project_pages/strand_burner/#design-iterations","title":"Design iterations","text":"<p>The design presented above is the fourth version of the strand burner. Over these iterations I evolved the design of the strand burner to make it more robust and useable. I also learned more about mechanical design during the year over which these revisions were made.</p>"},{"location":"project_pages/strand_burner/#version-1","title":"Version 1","text":"<p>In the first version, the propellant sample was mounted inside the chamber, and the chamber was made from acrylic to permit viewing. However, smoke from the exhaust filled the chamber, blocking the view of the burning sample. Also, the acrylic blistered and discolored after several firings, limiting the useful life of the device.</p> The version 1 strand burner: CAD model (left), assembled pressure vessel (right)."},{"location":"project_pages/strand_burner/#version-2","title":"Version 2","text":"<p>Version 2 of the strand burner solved these issues by mounting the sample on the outside of the chamber. This required the sample tube be loaded with internal pressure. Despite the poor tensile properties of quartz glass, I was able to find a sufficiently thick-walled tube to meet this load. However, v2 revealed a new set of flaws: its backpressure regulator became corroded and clogged with soot, and as the regulator clogged the internal pressure varied. Also, reloading a propellant sample in v2 required removing and replacing several #6 screws, and installing a new pyrotechnic igniter. We wear fire-resistant gloves when handling propellant, so these dexterous operations were slow and frustrating.</p>"},{"location":"project_pages/strand_burner/#version-3","title":"Version 3","text":"<p>Version 3 solved these problems: a large chamber reduces pressure variations, a stainless steel backpressure regulator resists corrosion, and filters prevent soot from reaching the regulator. The propellant sample is installed and removed with a toggle clamp, and the laser igniter is reusable. However, on v3 the laser was mounted across the plenum from the propellant sample. The angular alignment of the laser had to be very precise (&lt; 0.5 deg) to keep the laser spot on the propellant sample. Bumping the apparatus could knock the laser out of alignment.</p> The version 3 strand burner design drawing. Not that the Laser Mount is on the opposite end of the Chamber from the Sample Holder.

Mounting the laser close to the propellant sample makes the system much less sensitive to the alignment of the laser. The v4 strand burner is robust and easy to use.</p>"}]}
